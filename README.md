## Overview

The align-DNA nextflow pipeline, aligns paired-end data utilizing [BWA-MEM2](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2) and/or [HISAT2](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/main), [Picard](https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard) Tools and [Samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools). The pipeline has been engineered to run in a 4 layer stack in a cloud-based scalable environment of CycleCloud, Slurm, Nextflow and Docker. Additionally, it has been validated with the SMC-HET dataset and reference GRCh38, where paired-end fastq’s were created with BAM Surgeon.

The pipeline should be run **WITH A SINGLE SAMPLE AT A TIME**. Otherwise resource allocation and Nextflow errors could cause the pipeline to fail.

<b><i>Developer's Notes:</i></b>

> For some reads with low mapping qualities, BWA-MEM2 assigns them to different genomic positions when using different CPU-numbers. If you want to 100% reproduce a run, the same CPU-number (`bwa_mem_number_of_cpus`) needs to be set.

> BWA-MEM2 now only supports five CPU instruction set, AVX, AVX2, AVX512, SSE4.1 and SSE4.2. However we only tested the pipeline on AVX2 and AVX512 CPUs.

> We performed a benchmarking on our SLURM cluster. Using 56 CPUs for alignment (`bwa_mem_number_of_cpus`) gives it the best performance. See [Testing and Validation](#Testing-and-Validation).

## How To Run

Pipelines should be run **WITH A SINGLE SAMPLE AT TIME**. Otherwise resource allocation and Nextflow errors could cause the pipeline to fail.

1. Make sure the pipeline is already downloaded to your machine. You can either download the stable release or the dev version by cloning the repo.  

2. Create a config file for input, output, and parameters. An example for a config file can be found [here](pipeline/nextflow.example.config). See [Inputs](#Inputs) for the detailed description of each variable in the config file. The config file can be generated using a python script (see below).

3. Create the input csv using the [template](pipeline/inputs/align-DNA.inputs.csv). The example csv is a single-lane sample, however this pipeline can take multi-lane sample as well, with each record in the csv file representing a lane (a paire of fastq). All records must have the same value in the **sample** column. See [Inputs](#Inputs) for detailed description of each column. All columns must exist in order to run the pipeline successfully.

4. The pipeline can be executed locally using the command below:

```bash
nextflow run path/to/align-DNA.nf -config path/to/sample-specific.config
```

To submit to UCLAHS-CDS's Azure cloud, use the submission script [here](https://github.com/uclahs-cds/tool-submit-nf) with the command below:

```bash
python path/to/submit_nextflow_pipeline.py \
    --nextflow_script path/to/pipeline-align-DNA.nf \
    --nextflow_config path/to/sample-specific.config \
    --pipeline_run_name <sample_name> \
    --partition_type midmem \
    --email jdoe@ucla.edu
```

<b><i> BWA-MEM2 Genome Index </i></b>
The reference genome index must be generated by BWA-MEM2 with the correct version. Genome index generated by old BWA-MEM2 versions or the original BWA is not accepted. The reference genome index can be generated using the [`generate-genme-index.nf`](pipeline/generate-genome-index.nf) nextflow pipeline. To run this pipeline, you need to create a config file using this [template](pipeline/config/index.config) to specify the path of `reference_fasta` and the `temp_dir`. The `temp_dir` is used to store intermediate files of nextflow. The genome index files are saved to the same directory of the input reference FASTA by the pipeline. Use the command below to run this generate genome index pipeline:

```bash
nextflow run path/to/generate-genome-index.nf -config path/to/genome-specific.config
```

This can also be submitted using the [submission script](https://github.com/uclahs-cds/tool-submit-nf) to the UCLAHS-CDS's Azure cloud as mentioned above.

> The BWA-MEM2 expects the reference genome index to be at the same directory as the reference genome FASTA, so it's important to keep them together.

<b><i> HISAT2 Genome Index </i></b>
The reference genome index must be generated from HISAT2 using [hisat2-build](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/howto/). When passing the hisat2 index to the config, only the path up to the prefix(basename) must be specified:

> The basename is the name of any of the index files up to but not including the final .1.ht2 / etc. hisat2 looks for the specified index first in the current directory, then in the directory specified in the HISAT2_INDEXES environment variable.

<b><i> Generating the config file using a script </i></b>

To learn how to run the script, use one of the following commands:
```bash
python path/to/pipeline-align-DNA/script/write_dna_align_config_file.py -h
python path/to/pipeline-align-DNA/script/write_dna_align_config_file.py param
python path/to/pipeline-align-DNA/script/write_dna_align_config_file.py example

```

See the following command for example:
```bash
python path/to/pipeline-align-DNA/script/write_dna_align_config_file.py \
	/my/path/to/sample_name.csv \
	bwa-mem2 \
	/hot/ref/hg38/bwa-mem2/v2.1/genome.fa \
	/my/path/to/output_directory \
	/my/path/to/temp_directory \
	--save_intermediate_files \
	--cache_intermediate_pipeline_steps
```

## Pipeline Steps

### 1A. Alignment

The first step of the pipeline utilizes [BWA-MEM2](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2) or [HISAT2](http://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/main) to align paired reads, (see Tools and Infrastructure Section for details). BWA-MEM2 is the successor for the well-known aligner BWA. The bwa-mem2 mem command utilizes the -M option for marking shorter splits as secondary. This allows for compatibility with Picard Tools in downstream process and in particular prevents the underlying library of Picard Tools from recognizing these splits as duplicate reads (read names). Additionally, the -t option is utilized toincrease the number of threads used for alignment. The number of threads used in this step is by default to allow at least 2.5Gb memory per CPU, because of the large memory usage by BWA-MEM2. This can be overwritten by setting the bwa_mem_number_of_cpus parameter from the config file. For more details regarding the specific command that was run please refer to the Source Code section.

### 1B. Convert Align SAM File to BAM Format

In the sampe step of the pipeline utilizes Samtool’sview command to convert the aligned SAM files into the compressed BAM format, (see Tools and Infrastructure Section for details). The Samtools view command utilizes the -s option for increasing the speed by removing duplicates and outputs the reads as they are ordered in the file.  Additionally, the -b option ensures the output is in BAM format and the -@ option is utilized to increase the number of threads. For more details regarding the specific command that was run please refer to the Source Code section.

### 2. Sort BAM Files in Coordinate or Queryname Order

The next step of the pipeline utilizes Picard Tool’s SortSam command to sort the aligned BAM files in coordinate order or queryname order that is needed for downstream tools, (see Tools and Infrastructure Section for details). The SortSam command utilizes the VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT option to indicate how errors should be handled and keep the process running if possible. Additionally, the SORT_ORDER option is utilized to ensure the file is sorted in coordinate order or queryname order depending on the downstream Mark Duplicates tool, since Picard and Spark have different sort-order requirements. For more details regarding the specific command that was run please refer to the Source Code section.

For certain use-cases the pipeline may be configured to stop after this step using the mark_duplicates parameter in the config file. In this case the file is sorted in coordinate order and the SortSam command utilizes the CREATE_INDEX option to index the sorted BAM file. This option is intended for datasets generated with targeted sequencing panels (like our custom Proseq-G Prostate panel). High coverage target enrichment sequencing (like Illumina's [protocol](https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing/dna-sequencing/targeted-resequencing/target-enrichment.html)) results in a large amount of read duplication that is not an artifact of PCR amplification. Marking these reads as duplicates will severely reduce coverage, and it is recommended that the pipeline be configured to not mark duplicates in this case.

## 3. Mark Duplicates in BAM Files

The next step of the pipeline utilizes Picard Tool’s MarkDuplicates command to mark duplicates in the BAM files, (see Tools and Infrastructure Section for details). The MarkDuplicates command utilizes the VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT option to indicate how errors should be handled and keep the process running if possible. Additionally, the Program_Record_Id is set to “MarkDuplicates”. For more details regarding the specific command that was run please refer to the Source Code section.

A faster Spark implementation of MarkDuplicates can also be used (MarkDuplicatesSpark from GATK). The process matches the output of Picard's MarkDuplicates with significant runtime improvements. An important note, however, the Spark version requires more disk space and can fail with large inputs with multiple aligners being specified due to insufficient disk space. In such cases, Picard's MarkDuplicates should be used instead.

## 4. Index BAM Files

After marking dup BAM files, the BAM files are then indexed by utilizing Picard Tool’sBuildBamIndex command, (see Tools and Infrastructure Section for details). This utilizes the `VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT` option to indicate how errors should be handled and keep the process running if possible. For more details regarding the specific command that was run please refer to the Source Code section.

## Testing and Validation

### Test Data Set

This pipeline was tested using the synthesized SMC-HET dataset as well as a multi-lane real sample CPCG0196-B1, using reference genome version GRCh38. Some benchmarking has been done comparing BWA-MEM2 v2.1, v2.0, and the original BWA. BWA-MEM2 is able to reduce approximately half of the runtime comparing to the original BWA, with the output BAM almost identical. See [here](https://uclahs.app.box.com/file/737244561716) for the benchmarking.
