## How to run the pipeline

**The pipeline should be run WITH A SINGLE SAMPLE AT TIME. Otherwise resource allocation and Nextflow errors could cause the pipeline to fail**

1. Update the params section of the .config file

2. Update the input csv

3. See the submission script, [here](https://github.com/uclahs-cds/tool-submit-nf/tree/bc-add-submission-script), to submit your pipeline
